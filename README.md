## Overview

Tribal Wars provides public access to game data for each world through standardized text files and API endpoints. This data can be used to create external tools, statistical analyses, map viewers, and other third-party applications. The data includes information about villages, players, tribes, conquests, and various ranking statistics.

## Data Access Guidelines

To ensure these resources remain available for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

- **Update Frequency**: All data files are updated approximately once per hour
- **Download Limit**: Fetch data no more than once per hour per file
- **Use Compression**: Always use the `.gz` compressed versions when available
- **Random Timing**: For automated scripts, use random timing within the hour
- **Respect Rate Limits**: Excessive requests may result in IP address blocking
- **Data Format**: All text data is comma-separated with URL-encoded strings

## Server URLs

Server URLs follow a standardized pattern based on world ID and language domain:

```
http://[world-id].[language-domain]/[endpoint]
```

**Examples:**
- German: `http://de68.die-staemme.de/`
- US: `http://us1.tribalwars.us/`
- Polish: `http://pl158.plemiona.pl/`

### Listing Available Servers

To obtain a complete list of active servers for a specific language domain:

```
http://www.die-staemme.de/backend/get_servers.php
```

This endpoint returns a serialized PHP array where each key is a server identifier (e.g., "de199" or "dec1") and each value is the corresponding server URL.

## Configuration Endpoints

The game provides several XML-formatted configuration files that contain important settings and parameters for each world:

## Additional Information

### Recent Conquests

### Recent Conquests Endpoint

To get only conquests since a specific time:
```
/interface.php?func=get_conquer&since=UNIX_TIMESTAMP
```
or the extended version:
```
/interface.php?func=get_conquer_extended&since=UNIX_TIMESTAMP
```

**Important Note**: The timestamp must be within the last 24 hours. If you use a timestamp older than 24 hours, you will receive an error:
```
ERR ONLY_ONE_DAY_AGO - Es sind nur die Adelungen der letzten 24 Stunden abrufbar
```
(Translation: "Only conquests from the last 24 hours are available")

Example usage:
```
https://pl213.plemiona.pl/interface.php?func=get_conquer&since=1747434771
```

The endpoint returns data in the same format as the respective conquer.txt files.

## World Map Background

**File path:** `/world.dat.gz`

This file contains information about the terrain type of each map coordinate, which is used to render the world map background.

The file has the following characteristics:
- Contains 1000 rows with 1000 bytes each (approximately 1MB in size)
- Each byte represents a map coordinate's terrain type
- Coordinates can be accessed using: `offset = y_coordinate * 1000 + x_coordinate`

**Terrain types and values:**
- `0-3`: Grass variations ("gras1.png", "gras2.png", "gras3.png", "gras4.png")
- `8-11`: Mountain variations ("berg1.png", "berg2.png", "berg3.png", "berg4.png")
- `12`: Lake ("see.png")
- `16-31`: Forest variations ("forest0000.png" through "forest1111.png")

The terrain graphics can typically be found at:
```
https://dsde.innogamescdn.com/asset/45436e33/graphic/map_new/[image_name]
```

## Data Relationships

The data across different files is interconnected through unique identifiers, forming a hierarchical relationship:

```
Village ‚Üí Player ‚Üí Tribe
```

These relationships work as follows:

1. **Village to Player**: 
   - Each village in `village.txt` has a `player_id` field
   - This ID can be used to look up the owner in `player.txt`

2. **Player to Tribe**:
   - Each player in `player.txt` has a `tribe_id` field
   - This ID can be used to look up the tribe in `ally.txt`

3. **Conquest Tracking**:
   - `conquer.txt` tracks village ownership changes
   - Links villages (`village_id`) to old and new owners (`old_owner_id` and `new_owner_id`)
   - Extended version also links to tribes (`old_tribe_id` and `new_tribe_id`)

This relationship structure allows you to:
- Find all villages belonging to a specific player
- Find all players belonging to a specific tribe
- Find all villages belonging to a specific tribe (indirectly)
- Track conquest history for any village, player, or tribe

To perform complex operations with this data, you'll need to join information from multiple files, either using database operations or application logic.
